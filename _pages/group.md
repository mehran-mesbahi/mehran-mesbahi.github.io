<strong style="color: red;">Research Group</strong>

The RAIN Lab is the research engine for our group; check out the
RAIN <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwrainlab/">website</a>

<strong style="color: red;">Prospective Students</strong>

If you are a prospective student interested in exploring joining the RAIN Lab, I highly recommend that you look at some of the work that has been done by the group and see if it aligns with what you aspire to do for your graduate work. Generally, the students who come to our group enjoy working on theoretical problems, coding, tinkering with hardware, and have a passion for aerospace control systems and robotics, as well as multi-disciplinary applications of systems, control, and optimization.
